    <p> Silkworms were first domesticated in China over 5,000 years ago.[21][22] Since then, the silk production
        capacity of the
        species has increased nearly tenfold. The silkworm is one of the few organisms wherein the principles of
        genetics and breeding were applied
        to harvest maximum output[citation needed]. It is second only to maize in exploiting the principles
        of heterosis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbreeding" title="the cross wiki page">crossbreeding</a> .</p>

    <p>Silkworm breeding is aimed at the overall improvement of silkworms from a commercial point of view.
        The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae,
        quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop.
        Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage,[23] shorter
        larval
        duration (this lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than
        the
        reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced are directly related to the pupation rate and larval
        weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights.  
        Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors, including genetics.</p>
